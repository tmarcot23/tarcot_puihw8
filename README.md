Description of Website

What is the purpose of your website?
- The purpose of my website is to show who I am, both professionally and personally. I want to show visitors my projects, experiences, and information about who I am outside of work and academics.

What information do you convey with your website?
- My website contains three pages: Portfolio, Resume, and About. The portfolio page is divided into three sections for projects: internships, courses, and extracurriculars. The resume page has a PDF viewer for my resume. The about page contains information about the trajectory of my professional career as well as a section where visitors can learn more personal information about me.

How is it interesting and engaging?
- I am to make my website interesting and engaging through interactive elements, animations, and drawings. On the homepage, I have a sentence that says “I enjoy ____”, where the blank is continuously replaced by a word relating to my professional interests. Below that sentence is a drawing of myself next to a blurb introducing me, and underneath that are personalized icons for the page navigation links. I made the about page engaging by including a “fun fact generator,” which allows users to click a button to generate a new fun fact about me. Each fact is written in HTML-style code with an accompanying picture.

Who is the target audience?
- The target audience for my portfolio are recruiters and anyone who is interested in learning about my professional experiences and taking a deep-dive into my projects. While my website contains mostly professional information, I want my target audience to also learn more about me as an individual.

Using my website
- Navigation bar: Clicking on “Tia Arcot” on the left side of the navigation bar takes the user back to the homepage. Clicking on the “Portfolio,” “Resume,” or “About” tabs takes the user to the respective pages.
- Contact me section on all pages: The “Contact me” section at the bottom of every page contains my email and LinkedIn; clicking the email link directs the user to their default mail program to send an email, and clicking on the LinkedIn link takes the user to my LinkedIn profile. The contact me section can be found on all pages.
- Homepage: Right above the “Contact me” section at the bottom of the page are page navigation links that function the same as the navigation bar - click on these icons to reach the respective page.
- Portfolio: Under the “Portfolio” title, the user can click on the “Internships,” “Courses,” or “Extracurriculars” buttons to navigate to those sections of the portfolio page. When the user continues to scroll down, a “back to top” arrow button will pop up on the button right that allows the user to scroll back to the top of the page. The user can click on a project to navigate to its respective project page.
- Individual project pages: Underneath the project description, the user can click on any of the boxes to access the project files.
- Resume: My resume is hosted in a frame which users can individually scroll.
- About: Above the “Contact me” section is a “fun fact generator.” Users can click on the “Generate a new fun fact!” button in order to replace the current fact and image with a new fact and image. This functions as a loop which iterates through an array and repeats the facts once the end of the array is reached.

External libraries
- The first tool I used was JQuery. I chose to use this tool because it simplified the process of writing Javascript functions and allowed me to easily create interactive features for my website. I used JQuery to create the “back to top” feature on the portfolio page and the “fun fact generator” on the about page.
- The second tool I used was CSS animations. I chose to use this tool because allowed me to easily create an infinite word-based animation. I used a CSS animation on the homepage to make a sentence that changes the final word every few seconds, which looks like “I enjoy ____”

Iteration from HW7
- I changed multiple aspects of my design from my HW7 mockups. I added the “Contact me” section to every page. On the portfolio page, I changed the appearance of the project boxes by adding images of each project and removing the description. I made minor changes as well such as changing colors, font sizes, and the position of elements.

Major challenges
- My biggest challenge with implementing my website was correctly utilizing Bootstrap. I was facing issues specifically with columns and rows, including left-aligning text and centering the text in the column along with implementing gutters. I resolved these issues through finding solutions on StackOverflow and implementing CSS features like margins.
